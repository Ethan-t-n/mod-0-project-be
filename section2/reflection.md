## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
 * Growth-minded individuals tend to practice more often and persevere in the face of difficulty
 * It is best to understand mistakes you've made in your previous code and change strategies to improve them
 * Seeking out challenges can improve your skill sets

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
 * I have been looking through my old practices/exercises for class and taking down notes on what I should do for next time.
 * I need to seek out more challenges in my free time so I can expand my knowledge and be ahead.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
 * A conditional is a statement that evaluates to true or false and can use signs like ==, >, >=, <, <=.
  * Examples:
  def running(runtime_in_a_mile)
    If runtime_in_a_mile < 11
      puts "That is a slow run time"
  end   

  def Studying(hours)
    If hours < 2
      puts "That is a good amount of time to study"
  end   

  def working(money_per_hour)
    If money_per_hour > 7
      puts "That is below minimum wage"
  end   

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
 * To use conditional statements to tell the program what to do with the information. It is great if you want to allow the program to simulate a decision based behavior. It also helps you learn other ways to structure your code and makes it more readable. These statements can also help you think outside the box.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
 * if (insert_here) < (insert_here2)
     puts "(insert_here_3)"
   end

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
 * by putting in "elsif" after the "if" part of the statement

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
 * def working(money_per_hour)
     If money_per_hour > 7
       puts "That is below minimum wage"
     elsif money_per_hour < 7
       puts "that is about minimum wage"
   end
