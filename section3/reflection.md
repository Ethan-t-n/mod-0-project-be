## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
 * taking a small break every 30 minutes helped me a lot in terms of helping me getting in some time to relax without getting distracted

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
 * I found myself more focused than I realized

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
 * An array is an ordered list. A hash is a collection of key/value pairs

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {Dog_Food: 60, Cat_Food: 50, Fish_Food: 30}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
puts states[1]
```

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
puts states.keys
puts states.values
```

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
 * I would say maybe linking contacts to their information such as phone numbers, emails, and addresses. Hashes would work better in this situation since we can find data stored for that specific person

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
 * No questions so far, I just need more practice with typing out both hashes and arrays as well as explore more methods via google
