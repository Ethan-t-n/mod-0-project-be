## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
 * Somewhere in between

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
 * print "Hello World!"

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
 * If it has the # symbol at the start

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
 * An integer is a number without a decimal while a float is a number with a decimal

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
 * animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
 * p "Wow, look at that #{animal}"

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
 * An interpolation is plugging in 2 variables in a line. Ex: p "Wow, look at that #[animal] it looks so #{Insert_another_variable_here}"

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
 * in ruby, it uses the "gets method"

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
 1. The "get the length string method" is used to check the length of the string before inserting it into a data base. From my understanding you just have to put ".length" after the code you put in ex: "Hello World.length"
 2. Another one that is commonly used is the "Empty sting check method". It is used for data validation. You just need to put ".empty" after the code you want to use. Ex: "output.empty"
